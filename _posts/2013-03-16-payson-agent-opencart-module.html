<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">This weekend, I have been working on integrating payson to a ecommerce website . (payson is a swedish leading online payment service provider).<br /><br /><br />There are 2 ways to integrate with payson payment gateway, one is through payson API, (http://api.payson.se/); the other one is through payson agent.<br />The problem with payson API approach is that payer is required to login to payson account in order to finish payment. this is not very convenient.<br />payson agent doesn't require payer to login and payment can be made by credit card and internet bank directly.<br /><br />Taking user&nbsp;experience&nbsp;into consideration, I decide to use payson agent integration. the website is based on opencart.&nbsp;unfortunately, payson doesn't provide official payment module for opencart, so I created one by myself.<br /><br /><b>Suported features:</b><br /><b><br /></b>1)Payson Guarantee (Paysongaranti) Escrow service support<br />2) Multiple payment options: credit card only, internet bank only, deposit in payson account, and all of them.<br />3) English and Swedish supported.<br />4) Supported Currencies: Swedish Krona (SEK).<br /><br />the code is on github: <a href="https://github.com/fuyi/payson-agent-opencart-module">https://github.com/fuyi/payson-agent-opencart-module</a><br /><br />If you want to see how it works live, you can visit the&nbsp;commerce&nbsp;site: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.bycase.se/">www.bycase.se</a><br /></div>
