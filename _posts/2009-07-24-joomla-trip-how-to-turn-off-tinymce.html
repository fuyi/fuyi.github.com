<span style="font-size:85%;">Today,  </span>I was editing a article in Joomla, I want to wrap text around a image, but I found this function doesn't work in Joomla.<br /><br />My WYSWYG editor in joomla is the default one: TinyMCE Version: <span id="version">3.2.4.1<br /><br />the probelm is : after I update the html element <img src="" /> with attribute style="float:left", which could implement text wrap effecct, this</span><span id="version"> update is automatically stripped away by TinyMCE. Thus, the text wrap doesn't work.<br /><br />I searched on web,  the answer to this question is: by default, TinyMCE enables "HTML filter" function, it strips away any html element from its content which is against its predefined rules, like XHTML standard.<br /><br />Obviously, in my case, "HTML filter"</span><span id="version"> function is enabled, which causes the probelm I encountered. There are several ways to solve this headover, The simpleast way is to turn off this function and allow any html element/attributes.<br /></span><br /><span id="version">I did the following steps:<br />1) Log into Joomla Administration backend<br /><br />2) Open TinyMCE configuration panel at :   Extension ---> Plugin manager ---> Editor TinyMCE<br /><br />3) Set 2 parameters as follows:<br /><br /></span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_THhgXyAEEI8/Smm-Ccsju_I/AAAAAAAACbE/fUO7b3On0uA/s1600-h/QQ%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D.png"><img style="cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 51px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_THhgXyAEEI8/Smm-Ccsju_I/AAAAAAAACbE/fUO7b3On0uA/s320/QQ%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE%E6%9C%AA%E5%91%BD%E5%90%8D.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5362025780633385970" border="0" /></a><br /><br />4) Ok!!<br /><br />now , TinyMCE won't strip away the html style definition.<br /><br />Note:  there are several options for tackling this issue, like we can define a class to image, which set float attribute; then attach this class to <img>
